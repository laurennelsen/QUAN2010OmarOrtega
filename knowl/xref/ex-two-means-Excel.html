<div class="para">(Donnelly Your Turn 1)</div> <div class="para">Major League Baseball officials (and many fans) have been concerned about the lengths of games, particularly playoff games.  Suppose the officials would like to test the hypothesis that the mean length of a playoff game is longer than the mean length of a regular season game.  The data in the Excel file below shows the length of games, in minutes, for randomly selected games from the regular season and from the playoffs.  Assume the standard deviations of the playoff and regular season games are 25 and 21 minutes respectively.  Using <span class="process-math">\(\alpha = 0.02\text{,}\)</span> can we conclude that playoff games are longer, on average, than regular season games?</div> <div class="para"><a class="external" href="external/sheets/MLBGames.xlsx" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">external/sheets/MLBGames.xlsx</code></a></div>
