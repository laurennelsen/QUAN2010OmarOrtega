<div class="para">(Donnelly 10.7)</div> <div class="para">Suppose the Bureau of Labor Statistics would like to investigate if the average retirement age for a worker in Japan is higher than the average retirement age for a worker in the United States.  A random sample of 30 retired U.S. workers had an average retirement age of 64.6 years.  A random sample of 30 retired Japanese workers had an average retirement age of 67.5 years.  Assume the population standard deviation for the retirement age in the U.S. is 4.0 years and for Japan is 4.5 years.  Perform a hypothesis test using <span class="process-math">\(\alpha=0.05\)</span> to determine if the average retirement age in Japan is higher than it is in the United States.</div>
