Pollsters are concerned about declining levels of cooperation among persons contacted in surveys.  A pollster contacts 104 people in the 18-21 age bracket and finds that 88 of them respond and 16 refuse to respond.  When 277 people in the 22-29 age bracket are contacted, 251 respond and 26 refuse to respond.  Assume that 1 of the 381 people is randomly selected.  Find the probability of getting someone in the 18-21 age bracket <em>OR</em> someone who agreed to respond.</p>
