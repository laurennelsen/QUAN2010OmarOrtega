Pollsters are concerned about declining levels of cooperation among persons contacted in surveys.  A pollster contacts 75 people in the 18-21 age bracket and finds that 64 of them respond and 11 refuse to respond.  When 295 people in the 22-29 age bracket are contacted, 271 respond and 24 refuse to respond.  Assume that 1 of the 370 people is randomly selected.  Find the probability of getting someone in the 22-29 age bracket <em>OR</em> someone who agreed to respond.</p>
