Pollsters are concerned about declining levels of cooperation among persons contacted in surveys.  A pollster contacts 90 people in the 18-21 age bracket and finds that 76 of them respond and 14 refuse to respond.  When 275 people in the 22-29 age bracket are contacted, 252 respond and 23 refuse to respond.  Assume that 1 of the 365 people is randomly selected.  Find the probability of getting someone in the 18-21 age bracket <em>OR</em> someone who refused to respond.</p>
