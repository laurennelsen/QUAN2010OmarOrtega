<statement>
<p>Kelly is conducting market research on the cost of  homeowners insurance. Kelly has determined that the average annual cost of  homeowners insurance is <dollar/>835, and that the distribution of costs is normally distributed with a standard deviation of <dollar/>95. </p>
<p>a. Find the probability that a single randomly selected consumer spends more than <dollar/>779 on  homeowners insurance.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><fillin characters="20" /></p>
<p>b. The cost of the middle 50<percent/> of  homeowners insurance policies falls between (round to the nearest dollar):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><dollar/><fillin characters="20" /> to <dollar/><fillin characters="20" /> per year.</p>
<p>c. The <em>most expensive </em>20<percent/> of  homeowners insurance policies cost at least how much annually?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><dollar/><fillin characters="20" /></p>

</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>0.7222</li><li>771</li><li>899</li><li>915</li></ul></p><p>Define the normal distribution in Desmos: <m>\displaystyle{N}=\text{normaldist}{\left({835},{95}\right)}</m>.</p>
<p>a. <m>\displaystyle{P}{\left({x}{>}{779}\right)}={N}.{c}{d}{f{{\left({779},\infty\right)}}}={0.7222}</m></p>
<p>b. For the middle 50<percent/> of the data, need the remaining 50<percent/> of the data split between the left and right tails of the distribution. So the lower bound of the range has <m>\displaystyle{0.25}</m> of the area to the left and the upper bound of the range has <m>\displaystyle{0.25}</m> of the area to the right, which means <m>\displaystyle{0.75}</m> to the left. Therefore:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Lower bound <m>\displaystyle={N}.\text{inversecdf}{\left({0.25}\right)}={771}</m></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Upper bound <m>\displaystyle={N}.\text{inversecdf}{\left({0.75}\right)}={899}</m></p>
<p>c. For the most expensive 20<percent/> of the distribution, need <m>\displaystyle{0.2}</m> of the area to the right of the data value, so need <m>\displaystyle{1}-{0.0}{.2}={0.8}</m> to the left. Therefore:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"> <m>\displaystyle{x}={N}.\text{inversecdf}{\left({0.8}\right)}={915}</m> </p>
</solution>
