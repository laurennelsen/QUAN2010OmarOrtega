<statement>
<p>Marcelo is conducting market research on the cost of  homeowners insurance. Marcelo has determined that the average annual cost of  homeowners insurance is <dollar/>1332, and that the distribution of costs is normally distributed with a standard deviation of <dollar/>62. </p>
<p>a. Find the probability that a single randomly selected consumer spends less than <dollar/>1259 on  homeowners insurance.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><fillin characters="20" /></p>
<p>b. The cost of the middle 50<percent/> of  homeowners insurance policies falls between (round to the nearest dollar):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><dollar/><fillin characters="20" /> to <dollar/><fillin characters="20" /> per year.</p>
<p>c. The <em>most expensive </em>15<percent/> of  homeowners insurance policies cost at least how much annually?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><dollar/><fillin characters="20" /></p>

</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>0.1195</li><li>1290</li><li>1374</li><li>1396</li></ul></p><p>Define the normal distribution in Desmos: <m>\displaystyle{N}=\text{normaldist}{\left({1332},{62}\right)}</m>.
  </p>
<p>
  a. <m>\displaystyle{P}{\left({x}{<}{1259}\right)}={N}.{c}{d}{f{{\left({1259}\right)}}}={0.1195}</m>
  <less/>/p<greater/></p>
<p>
  b. For the middle 50<percent/> of the data, need the remaining 50<percent/> of the data split between the left and right tails of the distribution. So the lower bound of the range has <m>\displaystyle{0.25}</m> of the area to the left and the upper bound of the range has <m>\displaystyle{0.25}</m> of the area to the right, which means <m>\displaystyle{0.75}</m> to the left. Therefore:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Lower bound <m>\displaystyle={N}.\text{inversecdf}{\left({0.25}\right)}={1290}</m></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Upper bound <m>\displaystyle={N}.\text{inversecdf}{\left({0.75}\right)}={1374}</m></p>
<p>c. For the most expensive 15<percent/> of the distribution, need <m>\displaystyle{0.15}</m> of the area to the right of the data value, so need <m>\displaystyle{1}-{0.0}{.15}={0.85}</m> to the left. Therefore:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"> <m>\displaystyle{x}={N}.\text{inversecdf}{\left({0.85}\right)}={1396}</m> </p>
</solution>
