<statement>
<p>Reshanda is conducting market research on the cost of  homeowners insurance. Reshanda has determined that the average annual cost of  homeowners insurance is <dollar/>1164, and that the distribution of costs is normally distributed with a standard deviation of <dollar/>80. </p>
<p>a. Find the probability that a single randomly selected consumer spends less than <dollar/>1246 on  homeowners insurance.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><fillin characters="20" /></p>
<p>b. The cost of the middle 40<percent/> of  homeowners insurance policies falls between (round to the nearest dollar):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><dollar/><fillin characters="20" /> to <dollar/><fillin characters="20" /> per year.</p>
<p>c. The <em>most expensive </em>20<percent/> of  homeowners insurance policies cost at least how much annually?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><dollar/><fillin characters="20" /></p>

</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>0.8473</li><li>1122</li><li>1206</li><li>1231</li></ul></p><p>Define the normal distribution in Desmos: <m>\displaystyle{N}=\text{normaldist}{\left({1164},{80}\right)}</m>.</p>
<p>a. <m>\displaystyle{P}{\left({x}{<}{1246}\right)}={N}.{c}{d}{f{{\left({1246}\right)}}}={0.8473}</m><less/>/p<greater/></p>
<p>b. For the middle 40<percent/> of the data, need the remaining 60<percent/> of the data split between the left and right tails of the distribution. So the lower bound of the range has <m>\displaystyle{0.3}</m> of the area to the left and the upper bound of the range has <m>\displaystyle{0.3}</m> of the area to the right, which means <m>\displaystyle{0.7}</m> to the left. Therefore:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Lower bound <m>\displaystyle={N}.\text{inversecdf}{\left({0.3}\right)}={1122}</m></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Upper bound <m>\displaystyle={N}.\text{inversecdf}{\left({0.7}\right)}={1206}</m></p>
<p>c. For the most expensive 20<percent/> of the distribution, need <m>\displaystyle{0.2}</m> of the area to the right of the data value, so need <m>\displaystyle{1}-{0.0}{.2}={0.8}</m> to the left. Therefore:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"> <m>\displaystyle{x}={N}.\text{inversecdf}{\left({0.8}\right)}={1231}</m> </p>
