                    Two events are <em>independent</em> if the occurrence of one event has no impact on the occurrence of the other event.  The definition for two independent events is:
                    <me>P(A|B)=P(A)</me>

                <p>
                    Events are <em>dependent</em> if the occurrence of one event affects the occurrence of another event.

        <introduction>
          <p> A delivery service operates in a city where it snows in the winter. Suppose it is now winter. We consider the events that on a randomly selected day that they are late making deliveries, and the event that it snows that day. </p>
          <p> Suppose that the probability that the service is late on this day is <m>0.17</m>, the probability that the service is late given that it snows on this day is <m>0.7</m>, and finally the probability that it snows on this day is <m>0.18</m>. </p>
        </introduction>
          <task>
            <statement>
              <p> Find the probability that the service is late and it snows on this day. </p>
            </statement>
            <answer>
              <p> The probability that the service is late and it snows on this day is <m>0.126</m>. </p>

            </statement>
            <answer>
              <p> The probability that it snows, given that the service is late on this day is <m>0.7411764705882352</m>. </p>

            <statement>
              <p> Are the events the service is late on this day, and it snows on this day independent? Explain your reasoning. </p>
            </statement>
            <answer>
              <p> The events the service is late on this day, and it snows on this day are <em>not independent</em> because the probability that it snows, given that service is late is <em>not equal</em> to the probability that it snows. </p>
              <p>
                (The events are <em>dependent</em>.)

  <statement>
    <p>
        The <em>multiplication rule</em> for probabilities is used to calculate the probability for intersection (or joint probability) of two events occurring.
    </p>

    <p>
        It depends on knowing whether or not two events are independent or dependent.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    For dependent events, <me>P(A\cap B)=P(B)\cdot P(A|B)</me>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    For independent events, <me>P(A\cap B)=P(A)\cdot P(B)</me>

  <exercise>
    <statement>
        <p>
            A company has 140 employees, of which 30 are supervisors.  Eighty of the employees are married, and 20% of the married employees are supervisors.  If a company employee is randomly selected, what is the probability that employee is married and is a supervisor?
        </p>
    </statement>
    <answer>
        <p>
            <me>\left( \frac{80}{140} \right)\left( 0.2 \right)\approx 0.1143</me>
        </p>
