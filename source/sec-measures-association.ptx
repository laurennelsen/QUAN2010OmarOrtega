  <title>Measures of Association Between Two Variables</title>


  <introduction>
    <p>
        So far, the statistics we've studied have all dealt with describing one variable at a time.  Measures of association describe the relationship between two variables.

            A regional manager at Acme markets would like to develop a model to predict weekly sales of pet food based on the shelf space.  The data in the Excel file below shows the results collected from nine randomly selected stores.

        <answer>
            <p>
                Since r is almost exactly in the middle of 0 and 1, there is a moderate positive relationship between shelf space and sales.
