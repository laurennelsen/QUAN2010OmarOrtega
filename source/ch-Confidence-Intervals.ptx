  <title>Confidence Intervals</title>

<introduction>
    <p>
        One of the most important skills that you will learn in business statistics is to gather information from a sample and then use it to make a statement about the population from which it was chosen. The goal is to estimate the value of a population parameter using a sample statistic. For example, we might estimate the population mean, <m>\mu</m>, with the sample mean <m>\overline{x}</m>. But just how good is the estimate for the sample? Confidence intervals help us answer the question.
