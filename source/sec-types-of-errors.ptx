  <title>Type I and Type II Errors</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
        Recall that the purpose of a hypothesis test is to verify the validity of a claim about a population based on a single sample.  Since we are relying on a sample, there is risk that the conclusions we draw about the population will be wrong due to sampling error.
