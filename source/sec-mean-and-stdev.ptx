  <title>Using the Mean and Standard Deviation Together</title>

  <introduction>

<p>
    There are a few important concepts that use the mean and standard deviation together to describe data sets.
</p>


</introduction>

<definition xml:id="def-cv">
    <statement>
        <p>
            The <em>coefficient of variation (cv)</em> measures the standard deviation in terms of its percentage of the mean.
        </p>
        <p>
            <me>\text{formula:} \text{  cv}=\frac{\sigma}{\mu}\cdot 100\text{  or  } \frac{s}{\overline{x}}\cdot 100</me>

<definition xml:id="def-z-score">
    <statement>
        <p>
            The <em><m>z</m>-score</em> identifies the number of standard deviations a particular value is from the mean of its distribution.

        <p>
            <me>\text{formula:  } z=\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\text{  or  } \frac{x-\overline{x}}{s}\cdot 100</me>

<exercise xml:id="ex-weights-z">
    <introduction>
        <p>
            The mean weight of newborn infants is 7 pounds, and the standard deviation is 0.8 pound.  The weights of newborn infants are <em>normally distributed</em>.  (This is a symmetric distribution that we'll talk more about in a later chapter.)

<exercise>
    <statement>
        <p>
            An employee satisfaction survey was given to employees, and they were asked to rate their overall satisfaction with their job from 0 to 10 (inclusive).  The average rating was 5.5, and the standard deviation was 1.2.  What is the satisfaction rating corresponding to a <m>z</m>-score of <m>-1.5</m>?

    <title>The Empirical Rule</title>

    <p>
        The <em>Empirical Rule</em> says that if a distribution follows a bell-shaped, symmetric curve centered around the mean, then we should expect:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    approximately <m>68\%</m> of the data to fall within <em>one</em> standard deviation of the mean,
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    approximately <m>95\%</m> of the data to fall within <em>two</em> standard deviations of the mean, and
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    approximately <m>99.7\%</m> of the data to fall within <em>three</em> standard deviations of the mean.

                Using the Empirical Rule, determine the range of prices that includes <m>68\%</m> of the homes around the mean.  (To do this, we need to assume that the selling prices of homes is bell-shaped and symmetric.)
            </p>
        </statement>
        <answer>
            <p>
                <m>68\%</m> of prices are within 1 standard deviation of the mean.  That is, <m>68\%</m> of prices are between the numbers <m>\mu\pm\sigma</m> (assuming the distribution of prices is bell-shaped and symmetric).
            </p>
            <p>
                <me>348000\pm 30000\rightarrow \boxed{\$ 318,000 \text{ to } \$378,000}</me>

                Using Chebyshev's Theorem, determine the range of prices that includes at least <m>91\%</m> of the homes around the mean.  (Using Chebyshev's Theorem, we don't need to assume anything about how the prices are distributed.)
            </p>
        </statement>
        <answer>
            <p>
                <me>1-\frac{1}{z^2}=0.91</me>
                <me>1-0.91=\frac{1}{z^2}</me>
                <me>0.09 = \frac{1}{z^2}</me>
                <me>0.09z^2 = 1</me>

            </p>
            <p>
                So the range of prices including values within <m>\sqrt{\frac{1}{0.09}}</m> of the mean will include at least <m>91\%</m> of the homes.
