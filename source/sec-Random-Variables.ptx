  <title>Random Variables</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Many things in our world involve some level of uncertainty.  We want to use tools from probability to make decisions and see what we can confidently say about whatever it is we're investigating.
    </p>

  <p> A <em>random variable</em> is a variable whose possible values are the result of some random process, or experiment. </p>


<p>
  Examples of Random Variables:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Coin toss: The number of heads from tossing two coins
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Dice: The outcome of rolling a die
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Stock dividend: The expected dividend payment on a stock
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Investment returns: The expected standard deviation of investment returns
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Cars passing a road: The number of cars that drive through a certain intersection in a given time period
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

        <p> Two Types of Random Variables:
            <ul> 
              <li> discrete random variable:  outcomes are whole numbers after performing an experiment</li>
              <li> continuous random variable:  outcomes are any numerical value (including decimals or fractions) after performing an experiment </li>
            </ul>

    Random variables can be <q>distributed</q> differently.  For example, think about how rolls of a die would be distributed versus how the heights of UCCS students would be distributed.

  <p>
    We're going to start by discussing distributions of <em>discrete</em> random variables, and then in <xref ref="ch-Continuous-Probability-Distributions"/> we will discuss distributions of <em>continuous</em> random variables.
