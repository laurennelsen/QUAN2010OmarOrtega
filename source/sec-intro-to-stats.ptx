    <title>Branches of Statistics:</title>

    <p>
        The three main branches of statistics are:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    descriptive
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    inferential
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    predictive
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Goal of <em>descriptive statistics</em>:  to summarize data quickly to get an overview of the information
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <em>predictive statistics</em> analyzes past data to predict future values and aid in making well-informed decisions
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    During our study of <em>inferential statistics</em>, we will learn a variety of techniques that allow us to draw conclusions about a population based on a sample of data.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <question>
        <p>
        In our study of inferential statistics, we might want to ask a question such as the following:
        </p>
        <p>
        <em>What is the average number of hours per week worked by students at UCCS?</em>
        </p>
        <p>
        How would you answer this question?
        </p>
    </question>

                A group of hotel owners in a large city decide to conduct a survey among citizens of the city to discover their opinions about casino gambling.
            </p>
        </introduction>

                    The population is the set containing all citizens of the city.

                <p>
                    One of the hotel owners suggests obtaining a sample by surveying all the people at six of the largest nightclubs in the city on a Saturday night.  The people surveyed will be asked to express their opinion on casino gambling.  Does this seem like a good idea?
                </p>
            </statement>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    No, it does not!  The people at the nightclub might not have the same attitude toward casino gambling as the population of all the city's citizens.
