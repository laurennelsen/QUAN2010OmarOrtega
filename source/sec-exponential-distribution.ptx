  <title>The Exponential Distribution</title>

<introduction>

  <definition>

    <p>
        
        The exponential probability distribution is a continuous distribution commonly used in business to measure the time between customer arrivals or the time between failures in a business process

    </p>

    <p>
        The mathematical expression that describes the shape of the curve for the exponential probability distribution is called the exponential probability density function:
        <me>f(x)=\lambda^{-\lambda x}\text{, where }\lambda=\text{the mean number of occurrences over an interval}</me>
    </p>

    <p>
        Recall the we saw <m>\lambda</m> in a previous chapter when the discrete Poisson distribution was introduced.  It is not a coincidence that we are using <m>\lambda</m> in both of these distributions.  A <em>discrete</em> random variable that follows a Poisson distribution with a mean equal to <m>\lambda</m> has a counterpart <em>continuous</em> random variable that follows the exponential distribution with a mean equal to <m>\mu=\frac{1}{\lambda}</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is easy to confuse the two -- try to remember that <m>\lambda</m> is a countable (discrete) rate while <m>\mu</m> is a measurable (continuous) interval.
    </p>

    <p>
        A small bit of good news:  the standard deviation for an exponential distribution is equal to its mean.  That is, <m>\sigma=\mu=\frac{1}{\lambda}</m>.
    </p>

    </definition>


</introduction>

    <p>
    The only parameter in the formula is <m>\lambda</m>.  Let's look at how it impacts the shape of the distribution.

<ol>
    <li>
        <p>
            The shape of the exponential distribution is right-skewed while the shape of the normal distribution is bell-shaped and symmetric.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The shape of the exponential distribution is controlled by only one parameter, <m>\mu</m>, while the shape of the normal distribution requires two parameters, <m>\mu</m> and <m>\sigma</m>.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The values of an exponential distribution are always positive; they can never be negative.  Values of the normal distribution can be both positive and negative.

            <title>Computing Probabilities for the Exponential Distributions</title>


            <p>
                There is no table for helping us calculate probabilities associated with an exponential distribution.  So we will rely on a formula and Excel to help with these calculations.  The formula for calculating the probability that a random variable is less than a specified value is:
                <me>P(x\leq a)=1-e^{-a\lambda}</me>
                where <m>\lambda=\text{the mean number of occurrences over an interval}</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Excel formula for calculating probabilities for the exponential distribution is
                <me>EXPON.DIST(x,\lambda,\text{cumulative}),</me>
                where cumulative=TRUE (if you want cumulative probability) or FALSE (if you do not want cumulative probability).
            </p>
