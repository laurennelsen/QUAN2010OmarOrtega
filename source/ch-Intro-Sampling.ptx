  <title>Introduction to Sampling</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
        We're going to talk about different ways to sample from a population, but before we do that it might be helpful to review a few terms we learned earlier in the course:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    A <em>population</em> represents all possible subjects of interest.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    A <em>parameter</em> is a value that describes a characteristic of a population.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    A <em>sample</em> is a subset of a population
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    A <em>statistic</em> is a value calculated from a sample and it estimates the value of a parameter.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
