  <title>The Sampling Distribution of the Proportion</title>


<introduction>

  <p>
    So far, the focus in this chapter has been on the distribution of sample means.  However, sometimes we deal with business scenarios where we are counting observations in a sample and in this case the sample proportion (or percentage), <m>\overline{p}</m>, is the statistic that is relevant rather than the sample mean, <m>\overline{x}</m>.

    <p>
      We're going to get in groups, and in each group, you'll roll a die <m>30</m> times.  (Use this Excel document to keep track of your rolls:  <url href="external/sheets/DiceSamplingProportion.xlsx" />
      )  Count how many times you roll a <q>1</q> and use that to calculate the <em>proportion</em> of the 30 rolls for which the result was a <q>1</q>.  After the whole class finishes finding this proportion, we're going to draw a histogram of all the sample proportions. Before doing this, though, think about the following questions:

        What should the distribution of your individual rolls look like (approximately)?

  <task>
    <statement>
      <p>
        What do you think the approximate shape of the histogram of all sample proportions will be?  (Will it be skewed left, uniform, normal/bell-shaped, or skewed right?)
      </p>
    </statement>
  </task>
  <task>
    <statement>
      <p>
        What do you expect the approximate mean of the distribution of sample proportions to be?  (Will it be <m>1/100</m>, <m>1/6</m>, <m>6/100</m>, or <m>6</m>?)

        The <em>sampling distribution of the proportion</em> describes the pattern that the sample proportions tend to follow when randomly drawn from a population.  This distribution has a mean, <m>\overline{p}=\frac{x}{n}</m>, and a standard error (i.e. the standard deviation of the sample proportions), <m>\sigma_p=\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}</m>.

          What is the probability that between 97 and 104 parents from this sample <q>follow</q> their children on Instagram?

        <p>

        <p>
          If 81 parents responded that the <q>follow</q> their children on Instagram, does this result support the findings of the social media survey?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          <me>P\left(\overline{p}\leq \frac{81}{140}\right) \approx 0.0023</me>
          Since <m>0.0023\lt 0.05 </m> (less than <m>5\%</m>), the sample with only 81 parents answering <q>yes</q> is unusual.  Therefore, the survey results are questionable.
