  <title>Comparing Variances from Two Populations</title>
  
  <introduction>
<p>
    When we want to compare the variances of two samples, we do this by conducting a test of the ratio of the variances.  If the ratio is equal to <m>1</m>, then the variances are equal; if not, then they are unequal.
</p>

<p>
    The sample variances is a good estimate of the population variance.  Not surprisingly, the ratio of the two sample variances, <m>\frac{s_1^2}{s_2^2}</m>, drawn from their respective populations is a good estimate for the ratio of the two population variances, <m>\frac{\sigma_1^2}{\sigma_2^2}</m>.  The sampling distribution of <m>\frac{s_1^2}{s_2^2}</m> is <m>F</m>-distributed with <m>D_1=n_1-1</m> and <m>D_2=n_2-1</m> degrees of freedom if we have independent samples from two normal populations.  Since we are comparing two variances, the test statistic is:
    <me>F=\frac{s_1^2}{s_2^2}.</me>
</p>


<p>
    The formula for this test statistic is easy to compute by hand, nevertheless, we can also use Excel to do the work if we have raw data (not summary statistics).  After stating the two hypotheses, we will go to the <em>Data Analysis</em> tool and choose <q>F-Test Two-Sample for Variances</q> to complete the test.
</p>


</introduction>

<note>
  In general, if we are testing to see if one variance is larger than the other, we want to choose population 1 to be the one with the larger sample standard deviation so that we will be doing a right-tail test.

    <introduction>
      <p>
        A company is doing a hypothesis test on the variation in quality from two suppliers. Both distributions are normal, and the populations are independent. Use <m>\alpha=0.05</m>. A sample of 29 products were selected from Supplier 1 and a standard deviation of quality was found to be 5.8426. A sample of 30 products were selected from Supplier 2 and a standard deviation of quality was found to be 3.2156. Test to see if the variance in quality for Supplier 1 is larger than Supplier 2.

  <exercise>
    <introduction>
    <p>
    A statistics student wants to investigate salaries of men and women in a certain Fortune 500 company. Two samples of salaries of men and women employees were obtained independently and analyzed.  The sample data is in the Excel file below.  (Assume that the samples are from normal populations.)
    </p>

    <p>
    <url href="external/sheets/CompanySalaries.xlsx" />
    </p>
    </introduction>

    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Which of the samples has a larger sample standard deviation?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Use STDEV.S in Excel to find the sample standard deviations.
        </p>
        <p>
          <me>s_{\text{men}}=s_1\approx 15.0973</me>
        </p>
        <p>
          <me>s_{\text{women}}=s_2\approx 13.9944</me>
        </p>
      </answer>
    </task>
    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Use a <m>10\%</m> level of significance to decide whether there is sufficient evidence that in the Fortune 500 company, the standard deviation of the salary of men is greater than the standard deviation of the salary of women.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          <me>H_0: \sigma_1^2 \leq \sigma_2^2</me>
        </p>
        <p>
          <me>H_1: \sigma_1^2 \gt \sigma_2^2</me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Since we have the raw data from the samples, we can use <q>F-Test Two-Sample for Variances</q> in the Data Analysis tool in Excel.
        </p>
        <p>
          <url href="external/sheets/CompanySalariesSolution.xlsx" />

        </p>
        <p>
          From this, we'll get a p-value of approximately 0.4182, which is bigger than <m>\alpha=0.10</m>.  So we fail to reject the null hypothesis and do not have enough evidence to conclude that <m>\sigma_1^2 \gt \sigma_2^2</m>.
