  <title>Developing a Regression Model</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
    Now we are going to learn techniques to create models that fit our data.  Regression analysis is the modeling procedure that we will study.  We will discuss how to perform the calculations in the formulas involved in creating and assessing regression models.  However, in most cases we will rely on the <q>Regression</q> tool in the Data Analysis tab of Excel.

            Regression analysis enables us to describe a straight line that best fits the data.

            As a measure of productivity, Verizon Wireless records the number of customers each of its retail employees activates weekly.  An activation is defined as either a new customer signing a cell phone contract or an existing customer renewing a contract.  The data table found in this lesson's Excel file shows the number of weekly activations for eight randomly selected employees along with their job-satisfaction levels rated on a scale of <m>1-10</m> (<m>10=</m> Most satisfied).

A hospital would like to develop a regression model to predict the total hospital bill for a patient based on the age of the patient (<m>x_1</m>), the patient's length of stay (<m>x_2</m>), and the number of days in the hospital's intensive care unit (ICU) (<m>x_3</m>).  Data for these variables can be found in the table in the Excel file below.

<definition xml:id="def-least-squares">
    <statement>
        <p>
            The mathematical procedure that is used to find the regression line is the <em>least squares method</em>.  The least squares method aims to minimize the total squared error between the values of <m>y</m> and <m>\hat{y}</m>.  This sum is also called the <em>sum of squares error (SSE)</em>, and is definted by the formula
            <me>
                SSE=\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-\hat{y_i})^2.
            </me>

            Minimizing the SSE results in the best fitting line through the data points.
