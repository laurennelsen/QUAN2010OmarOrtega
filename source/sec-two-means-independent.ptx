  <title>Comparing Two Means with Independent Samples</title>

<introduction>
    <p>
        In this section, we study two-sample hypothesis tests and confidence intervals.  First, we will assume that the standard deviation, <m>\sigma</m>, is known.  Then we will look at the more realistic case where <m>\sigma</m> is unknown.

                        The <em>sampling distribution for the difference in means</em> is normal given normal populations or large samples (<m>n\geq 30</m>).  The mean of this sampling distribution is

    This formula is a little unwieldy so whenever we are dealing with raw data (not just summary statistics), we will use Excel to do all the time-consuming calculations.
</p>

<p> Now let's demonstrate the two ways we can perform this type of hypothesis test.  First, in <xref ref="ex-two-means-hand"/> we will complete the hypothesis test by hand, manually computing all of the required calculations.  Then in <xref ref="ex-two-means-Excel"/>> we will rely on Excel to do the calculations.  After stating the two hypotheses, we will navigate to the <em>Data Analysis</em> tool and choose <em>z-Test Two-Sample for Means</em> to complete the test.

            Suppose the Bureau of Labor Statistics would like to investigate if the average retirement age for a worker in Japan is higher than the average retirement age for a worker in the United States.  A random sample of 30 retired U.S. workers had an average retirement age of 64.6 years.  A random sample of 30 retired Japanese workers had an average retirement age of 67.5 years.  Assume the population standard deviation for the retirement age in the U.S. is 4.0 years and for Japan is 4.5 years.  Perform a hypothesis test using <m>\alpha=0.05</m> to determine if the average retirement age in Japan is higher than it is in the United States.

            Major League Baseball officials (and many fans) have been concerned about the lengths of games, particularly playoff games.  Suppose the officials would like to test the hypothesis that the mean length of a playoff game is longer than the mean length of a regular season game.  The data in the Excel file below shows the length of games, in minutes, for randomly selected games from the regular season and from the playoffs.  Assume the standard deviations of the playoff and regular season games are 25 and 21 minutes respectively.  Using <m>\alpha = 0.02</m>, can we conclude that playoff games are longer, on average, than regular season games?

    When we don't know the population standard deviations, we substitute the sample standard deviations in their place.  Recall from <xref ref="sec-Confidence-Interval-for-Mean-Sigma-Unknown"/> that this means the proper sampling distribution is the Student's <m>t</m>-distribution instead of the normal distribution (as long as the sample sizes are large and/or the samples are drawn from normal populations).
</p>

<p>
    In addition, we also need to determine whether or not to assume that the unknown variances are equal or unequal.  We could use the <m>F</m>-test from <xref ref="ch-Hypothesis-Variance"/> to draw this conclusion -- but most of the time (in this class) you will be told which situation applies.  Let's examine the formulas associated with each of these two cases.

                The test statistic, <m>t_{\overline{x}}</m>, has degrees of freedom, <m>df</m>, defined by the following formula:
                <me>df = \frac{\left( \frac{s_1^2}{n_1}+\frac{s_2^2}{n_2} \right)^2}{\frac{\left(\frac{s_1^2}{n_1}\right)^2}{n_1-1}+\frac{\left(\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}\right)^2}{n_2-1}}</me>
            </p>
            <p>
                This looks messy, but note that you've already computed <m>\frac{s_1^2}{n_1}</m> and <m>\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}</m> during the test statistic calculation!
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <em>Case 2:  The population variances are equal</em>, i.e. <m>\sigma_1^2=\sigma_2^2</m>
            </p>
            <p>
                In this scenario, the denominator of the test statistic (which recall from Case 1 includes the sample variances) gets simplified because we can pool the two sample variances.
            </p>
            <p>
                The test statistic and confidence interval formulas are:
                <me>t_{\overline{x}}=\frac{(\overline{x}_1-\overline{x}_2)-(\mu_1-\mu_2)_{H_0}}{\sqrt{s_p^2\left(\frac{1}{n_1}+\frac{1}{n_2}\right)}}\;\;\;\;\;\;\; (\overline{x}_1-\overline{x}_2)\pm t_{\alpha/2}\cdot\sqrt{s_p^2\left(\frac{1}{n_1}+\frac{1}{n_2}\right)}</me>
            </p>
            <p>
                The <em>pooled variance</em>, <m>s_p^2</m>, is the weighted average of 2 sample variances drawn from 2 populations.
            </p>
            <p>
                This formula is actually quite easy to use:
                <me>s_p^2 = \frac{(n_1-1)s_1^2+(n_2-1)s_2^2}{(n_1-1)+(n_2-1)}</me>
            </p>
            <p>
                The test statistic, <m>t_{\overline{x}}</m>, has degrees of freedom, <m>df=n_1+n_2-2</m>.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>


<p>
    Once again, we will rely on Excel to do these computations for us whenever we have raw data.  After stating the two hypotheses, go to the <em>Data Analysis</em> tool and choose <q><em>t-Test Two-Sample Assuming Equal Variances</em></q> or <q><em>t-Test Two-Sample Assuming Unequal Variances</em></q> to complete the test.

            The airline industry measures fuel efficiency by calculating how many miles one seat can travel, whether occupied or not, on one gallon of jet fuel.  The data in the Excel file below shows the fuel economy, in miles per seat, for 15 randomly selected flights on Delta and US Airways.  Perform a hypothesis test using <m>\alpha=0.05</m> to determine if the average fuel efficiency differs between the two airlines.  Assume the population variances for the fuel efficiency for these two airlines are not equal.

            During a decline in the housing market in the 2010s, it appeared that the average size of a newly-constructed house fell.  To investigate this trend, the square footages of a random sample of houses built in 2008 were compared to houses in 2018.  The following table summarizes the sample means and standard deviations for the two samples drawn in 2008 and 2018.  Assume that the population variances for the square footages of houses built in these two years are equal.

    A statistics student wants to verify the claim that in a certain Fortune 500 company the average salary of female employees is different from the average salary of male employees. Two samples of male and female workers were obtained independently and analyzed.  The sample data is in the Excel file below.  (Assume that the samples are from normal populations.)
