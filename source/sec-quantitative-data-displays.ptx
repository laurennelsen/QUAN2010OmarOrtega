    <title>Creating Histograms in Excel</title>

    Next we want to create histograms in Excel, but before doing that, we're going to download the <em>Data Analysis</em> tool in Excel that we will use to create histograms.  (Later in the course we will use this tool for many more things!)
    </p>

        <p>
            Let's go back to the iPad sales example from <xref ref="ex-iPadSales"/>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <url href="external/sheets/iPadSales.xlsx" />
        </p>
        <p>
            We're going to create a histogram for this data in two different ways.  First we're going to create a histogram using the <em>Data Analysis</em> tool that we just downloaded.
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        In the Excel file, go to the <em>Data</em> tab, and then on the right click on <q>Data Analysis</q>.  (If <q>Data Analysis</q> is not showing up, then the add-in has not been installed yet.)
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Choose the <q>Histogram</q> option.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Choose the data as the <q>Input range</q>, specify the bins, choose <q>Chart Output</q>, and specify the output range.

            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is the histogram and frequency distribution that we get by following these instructions:

            Does the frequency distribution that we got using the Data Analysis tool match the frequency distribution we got in <xref ref="ex-iPadSales"/>?
        </p>
    </exploration>


    <exploration>
        <p>
            Now let's create a histogram using Excel Charts instead of the Data Analysis tool.
        </p>
        <p>
            Go back to the iPad sales example from <xref ref="ex-iPadSales"/>.
        </p>
        <p>

            <li>
                <p>
                    Select the data (A1:A51) and then go to <q>Insert</q> and choose the Histogram option:
                    <image source="sheets/HistogramExcelCharts1.png">
                    </image>

            <li>
                <p>
                    Here is what we should get when we do this:
                    <image source="sheets/HistogramExcelCharts2.png">
                    </image>
                </p>
            </li>
           </ul> 
        </p>
        <p>
            Does the chart we got here look as good as the one we got using the Data Analysis add-in?
        </p>
        <p>
            There are some tweaks that we will make to the chart we got here to make it looks better, but the chart we created using the Data Analysis tool looked much better without having to do extra work tweaking it.

<subsection xml:id="subsec-grouped-quantitative-data">
    <title>Grouped Quantitative Data</title>

    Some data sets (particularly those with continuous data) require several values to be grouped into a single class.  This grouping prevents having too many classes in the frequency distribution, which would make it difficult to detect patterns in the data.  Ideally, the number of classes in a frequency distribution should be between 4 and 20.

    One method for determining the number of classes is the <q><m>2^k\geq n</m> Rule:</q>

    <definition xml:id="def-2k-n-rule">

            <p>  If we want to decide how many classes to use in a frequency distribution or histogram, we can let
                <tabular>
                    <row>

            </p>
            <p>
                The goal is to find the lowest value of <m>k</m> that satisfies the inequality <m>2^k\geq n</m>.

    <answer>
        <p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <m>2^5=32\lt 50</m>, so <m>5</m> is too small

                        <m>2^6=64\geq 50</m>, so <m>k=6</m> is a good choice.

    </answer>
</example>

<p>
    Once the number of classes, <m>k</m>, is decided, we must determine the width of each class.  The width is the range of the numbers that are put into each class.  The following formula calculates a good width:
    <me>\boxed{\text{Estimated class width:    } \frac{\text{Maximum}-\text{Minimum}}{k}}</me>
</p>

<exercise>

    Let's look back at the file from <xref ref="ex-DellHold"/>.

    </p>
    
    <p>
        We found that <m>k=6</m> is a good choice for the number of classes, and let's use that the find a good width to use for each class.
    </p>

    <answer>
        <p>
            Estimated class width:
            <me>\frac{17.4-0.6}{6}=\frac{16.8}{6}=2.8</me>
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's round up to a useful whole number that makes the distribution more readable:

                <em>Scatter plots</em> provide a visual of the relationship between two quantitative variables -- the <em>independent</em> and <em>dependent</em> variables.

                            The <em>dependent</em> variable is placed on the vertical axis of the scatter plot and is influenced by changes in the <em>independent</em> variable, which is placed on the horizontal axis.

        What is the independent variable and what is the dependent variable?
    </p>
    <answer>
        <p>
            The independent variable is the square footage, and the dependent variable is home price.  (The home price <em>depends</em> on the square footage.)
