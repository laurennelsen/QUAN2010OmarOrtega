        A <em>binomial experiment</em> is a probability experiment possessing the following characteristics:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              It has a fixed number of trials, <m>n</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
             Each trial has only two possible outcomes:  success or failure.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The probability of success, <m>p</m>, and the probability of failure, <m>q</m>, are constant.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Each trial is independent of the other trials.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <p>
        The outcomes of a binomial experiment and the corresponding probabilities of these outcomes are called a <em>binomial distribution</em>.

      <p>
        The probability of exactly <m>X</m> successes in <m>n</m> trials with probability of success, <m>p</m>, is
      </p>
      <me>P(X)=\frac{n!}{X!(n-X)!}p^X(1-p)^{n-X}\text{ for }X=0,1,2,...,n
      </me>
      <p>
        In this class, we can use Excel (and/or tables) instead of the formula above to calculate probabilities for a binomial distribution.  (As the number of trials in a binomial experiment increases, calculating the probabilities using the complex formula becomes tedious.)
      </p>
      <p>
        In Excel:
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>\text{The formula is } BINOM.DIST(x,n,p,\text{cumulative})\text{, where }\text{cumulative=TRUE (<m>x</m> or fewer successes) or FALSE (exactly <m>x</m> successes)}</m>
        </p>
        <p>
        <me>\boxed{ P(X\leq x)=BINOM.DIST(x,n,p,TRUE)\;\;\;\text{ and }\;\;\; P(X=x)=BINOM.DIST(x,n,p,FALSE) }</me>
      </p>

      <p>
        We can also use tables to find probabilities.  The appropriate table from your book is <em>Table 1</em>, and here is a link to a table you can use as well:
        <url href="https://uwf.edu/media/university-of-west-florida/colleges/cse/departments/mathematics-and-statistics/documents/student-resources/Binomial-Tables-1.pdf" />
      </p>

      


  <p>
    Good news!  The mean and standard deviation of a binomial distribution are simple computations:
    <me>\boxed{\mu=np}\;\;\;\;\text{ and }\;\;\;\; \boxed{\sigma=\sqrt{npq}}</me>
  </p>
