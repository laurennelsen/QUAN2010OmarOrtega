  <title>Introduction to Hypothesis Testing</title>

<introduction>
    <p>
        Hypothesis testing is one of the most widely used procedures in statistics today, so we will spend more than one chapter discussing it.  What is a hypothesis test?

        </p>

        <p>

The basic idea behind hypothesis testing is to assume that a population parameter equals some value (the null hypothesis), draw a sample and calculate a statistic, then use sampling distributions concepts to determine the likelihood of drawing such a sample, given the assumption of the parameter value.

        </p>

        <p>

Suppose we draw a random sample from the population and get a sample mean higher than the population mean.  How far it is from the population mean?  If <m>\mu</m>> is true, what is the probability that we would get this value?  Is it so different from our hypothesized mean that our hypothesis cannot be true?  We have to decide what <q>so different</q> means.  Our sampling distribution tells us that the mean of all possible sample means should be the same as <m>\mu</m>>, so we can use those probability concepts to decide whether we think this sample statistic is extreme enough from the hypothesized mean to reject the null hypothesis.
    </p>

    <p>
        The purpose of hypothesis statements is to draw a conclusion about population parameters, for which we do not have complete information.
    </p>
</introduction>


<example>
    <p>
    We want to say something about the average number of hours students at UCCS work per work.  Let's say that someone claims that this average is
    <me>13.5\text{ hours/week.}</me>
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                If we survey <m>2000</m> students on campus, and in this sample the average number of hours worked per week was <m>20</m>, would you believe the claim that <m>\mu=13.5</m>?
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                If we survey <m>10</m> students on campus, and in this sample the average number of hours worked was <m>14</m>, would you believe the claim that <m>13.5</m>?
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
</example>

<p>
    We would like to be able to use all the tools we've learned to confidently make statements about a population parameter based on a sample.
