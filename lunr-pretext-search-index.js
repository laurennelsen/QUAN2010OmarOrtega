There are two main types of data: quantitative data and qualitative data .  Let's define those and other types of data we will work with in this course. Then we will move on to review how Excel is used to create meaningful tables, charts, and graphs that summarize our data.         Quantitative data uses numbers to describe data.     Qualitative data uses descriptive terms, i.e. categories, to describe data.       Qualitative vs. Quantitative Data        Discrete values are based on observations that can be counted and are typically represented by whole numbers.     Continuous values are based on measured observations and can take on any real number.        Which of the following are discrete values?     number of iPads sold      number of light bulbs that burned for more than 1000 hours in a quality control program      weight      time      distance      number of hours a light bulb burned before going out      Which of the following are continuous values?     number of iPads sold      number of light bulbs that burned for more than 1000 hours in a quality control program      weight      time      distance      number of hours a light bulb burned before going out     Discrete vs. Continuous Data   Levels of Measurement       A nominal level of measurement deals strictly with qualitative data assigned to predetermined categories.  Examples: marital status, gender, political affiliation    An ordinal level of measurement has all the properties of nominal data but with the added feature that we can rank order values from highest to lowest.  Examples: college class level, course letter grade    An interval level of measurement deals strictly with quantitative data allowing the measurement of difference between categories with actual numbers in a meaningful way.  Examples: temperature (in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit), SAT score, birth year of baseball players    A ratio level of measurement has all the features of interval data but with the added benefit of having a true zero point.

We're going to make a frequency distribution for this data.   (The manager might want to know, for example, the percentage of days that 3 or fewer iPads were sold.)     Highlight D2:D7  (Note: the Bins are the classes in our distribution.)    type =FREQUENCY(A2:A51,C2:C7)     Hit together     Here is the frequency distribution we should get when we do this:      Creating Histograms in Excel  Next we want to create histograms in Excel, but before doing that, we're going to download the Data Analysis tool in Excel that we will use to create histograms. (Later in the course we will use this tool for many more things!)   Go to the link below to see instructions for downloading the Data Analysis tool in Excel:   Analysis ToolPak in Excel   (Note that there are different tabs with instructions for Windows and macOS.)    Let's go back to the iPad sales example from .     We're going to create a histogram for this data in two different ways. First we're going to create a histogram using the Data Analysis tool that we just downloaded.     In the Excel file, go to the Data tab, and then on the right click on Data Analysis . (If Data Analysis is not showing up, then the add-in has not been installed yet.)    Choose the Histogram option.      Choose the data as the Input range , specify the bins, choose Chart Output , and specify the output range.       Here is the histogram and frequency distribution that we get by following these instructions:    Does the frequency distribution that we got using the Data Analysis tool match the frequency distribution we got in ?    Now let's create a histogram using Excel Charts instead of the Data Analysis tool.  Go back to the iPad sales example from .        Select the data (A1:A51) and then go to Insert and choose the Histogram option:      Here is what we should get when we do this:       Does the chart we got here look as good as the one we got using the Data Analysis add-in?  There are some tweaks that we will make to the chart we got here to make it looks better, but the chart we created using the Data Analysis tool looked much better without having to do extra work tweaking it.  (There are more details in the textbook about the steps we'll work through in class.)    (Optional)   Frequency and Relative Frequency Distributions (Made in GeoGebra by David Gurney)       Grouped Quantitative Data Some data sets (particularly those with continuous data) require several values to be grouped into a single class. This grouping prevents having too many classes in the frequency distribution, which would make it difficult to detect patterns in the data. Ideally, the number of classes in a frequency distribution should be between 4 and 20. One method for determining the number of classes is the Rule:     Rule:   If we want to decide how many classes to use in a frequency distribution or histogram, we can let     number of classes      number of data points     The goal is to find the lowest value of that satisfies the inequality .     Let's look at the Excel file below and find the number of classes, , that we should use to create a frequency distribution.       , so we want so that .    , so is too small     , so is a good choice.       Once the number of classes, , is decided, we must determine the width of each class. The width is the range of the numbers that are put into each class. The following formula calculates a good width:   Let's look back at the file from .   We found that is a good choice for the number of classes, and let's use that the find a good width to use for each class.  Estimated class width:   Let's round up to a useful whole number that makes the distribution more readable:    Let's look back at the file from .   We found that a good class width would be 3, so let's make a frequency distribution with 6 classes, each with a width of 3. (I recommend first sorting the data to make your distribution.)  In you created a frequency distribution for the data in the Dell Hold Times file. Let's use Excel to create a frequency distribution without having to count the number of items in each class ourselves. In the file below, we're going to create a Bins column that has an upper bound for each class, and then we're going to use the bins to create the frequency distribution.     In the Bins column, enter an upper bound for each class. (For example, in E9 , we could enter .)    Our Bins are in Column E in the file above. Now highlight F9:F14 and type =FREQUENCY(A2:A51, E9:E14) . Then hit enter.     We should get the frequency distribution below when doing this.     (Donnelly 2.9) The table in the Excel file below lists the receipt total for 350 randomly selected customers for the home improvement store Lowe's.      Using Excel and the rule, construct a frequency distribution for the data.    Using the found above, calculate the relative frequencies for each class.    Using the results from above, calculate the cumulative relative frequencies for each class.    Construct a histogram.           Shapes of Histograms       A distribution of data is symmetric if the right and left sides of the distribution are mirror images    A distribution of data is skewed if a large number of data items are piled up at one end or the other, with a tail at the opposite end.      skewed to the right : the tail is to the right     skewed to the left : the tail is to the left           Shapes of Distributions (Made in GeoGebra by Samantha Garcia and Lauren Nelsen)      Scatter Plots     Scatter plots provide a visual of the relationship between two quantitative variables -- the independent and dependent variables.     The dependent variable is placed on the vertical axis of the scatter plot and is influenced by changes in the independent variable, which is placed on the horizontal axis.       Let's look at the example below with home prices and square footage:  Scatter Plot powered by Desmos    What is the independent variable and what is the dependent variable?  The independent variable is the square footage, and the dependent variable is home price. (The home price depends on the square footage.)   (Donnelly 2.58) A marketing research firm would like to display the relationship between a family's monthly food costs and the number of family members living in a househould. The data in the Excel file below contains the monthly food costs and the number of family members for 16 families. Construct a scatter plot and describe the relationship between the number of household members and the family's monthly food costs.           A line chart is a special type of scatterplot in which the data points in the scatter plot are connected with a line.  Below is an example of a line chart. (Check the box to see the line chart.)

Are numbers lined up with tick marks on the vertical axis that clearly indicate the scale? Has the scale been varied to create a more or less dramatic impression than shown by the actual data?    Do too many design and cosmetic effects draw attention from or distort the data?    Has the wrong impression been created about how the data are changing because equally spaced time intervals are not used on the horizontal axis? Furthermore, has a time interval been chosen that allows the data to be interpreted in various ways?    Are bar sizes scaled proportionately in terms of the data they represent?    Is there a source that indicates where the data in the display came from? Do the data come from an entire population or a sample? Was a random sample used and, if so, are there possible differences between what is displayed in the graph and what is occurring in the entire population?

  "body": " Introduction to Probability   Decision makers, including those in the business world, are greatly influenced by uncertainty. Probability provides a valuable tool in quantifying uncertainty, leading to greater success in decision-making.     A probability is a numerical value between 0 and 1 that measures the chance, or likelihood, that a specific event will occur.    Before jumping into some examples, let's discuss some key terms for our study of probability concepts.       An experiment results in a specific outcome e.g., a coin flip (the experiment) results in a heads or a tails (the outcome).    An event is a collection of outcome(s) of an experiment, e.g., a die roll results in an odd number . More specifically, a simple event is an event with a single outcome.    The sample space for an experiment consists of all possible outcomes e.g., .    The outcomes must be collectively exhaustive and mutually exclusive .     Collectively exhaustive means every simple event is included     Mutually exclusive means events that cannot occur at the same time.            A single die is rolled.   Define the sample space.       Define the event an odd number is rolled . What is the probability of this event?        A pair of dice are rolled.   Define the sample space. (How many total possible outcomes are there?)    There are 36 total possible outcomes.   Define the event doubles are rolled . What is the probability of this event?        Define the event the sum of the dice is 10 . What is the probability of this event?

What is the probability of randomly selecting an executive who earned $100,000 or more per year?       What is the probability of randomly selecting an executive who earned $60,000 or more per year?       What is the probability of randomly selecting an executive who earned between $70,000 and $90,000 per year?        Basic Properties of Probability:   If , then event is certain to occur.    If , then event is certain to NOT occur.    The probability of any event must range between 0 and 1 (inclusive).    The sum of all probabilities of simple events in a sample space is equal to 1.       The complement , (or ), is defined as all outcomes in the sample space that are not in .      The complement rule:      Draw one card from a standard deck of 52 playing cards. (Here is a link to a description of a deck of cards: )   How many total outcomes are in the sample space for this experiment?       What is the probability of drawing a face card ?

For example, what average value would we expect rolling a die or playing a gambling game? How spread out are the values? These are all questions we want to be able to answer.   The 2020 United States Census found the number of households of different sizes. (Source: Table H2 from )  Below are the probabilities for different values of household size.

The mean, or expected value of a discrete probability distribution is the weighted average of all outcomes of the random variable.     The expected monetary value is the mean when the discrete random variable is in dollars ($)    The variance of a discrete probability distribution measures the spread of the individual values around the mean.     The standard deviation of a discrete probability distribution measures the dispersion of the outcome of the random variable in relation to the mean.         (Donnely 5.7) The table below shows the discrete probability distribution for the number of bedrooms per house in a certain community:    of Bedrooms  Probability    3  0.23    4  0.57    5  0.14    6  ???

  "title": "The Normal Distribution",
  "body": " The Normal Distribution    Continuous Probability Distribution Matching Problem  Match each probability distribution with the situation in which it is useful.    Normal Distribution   Useful when data tends to fall in the center and extreme values are rare     exponential distribution   Useful when low values for data occur often and high values are rare     uniform distribution   Useful when data of all values have an equal chance of occurring     The mathematical expression that describes the shape of the normal probability distribution is called the normal probability density function: Despite the complexity of this function, there are only two parameters that completely deter- mine the shape of the distribution: the mean, , and the standard deviation, . Let’s take a closer look at how they impact the distribution. (Don’t worry---we won’t be using this formula to compute probabilities. We have other tools!)    How does changing the standard deviation ( ) and the mean ( ) change the curve?  Graph of Normal Distribution powered by Desmos           controls the spread of the curve. Larger results in a flatter, more spread out curve     controls the location of the center. Larger shifts the hill of the curve to the right        Characteristics of the Normal Probability Distribution:     The distribution is bell-shaped and symmetric around the mean.    Because the shape is symmetrical, the mean and median are equal and located at the center of the distribution.    Random variables around the mean, where the curve is the tallest have a higher probability of occurring than values toward the end of the distribution.    The total area under the curve is . Since the distribution is symmetric, the area to the left of the mean equals as does the area to the right of the mean    No matter how far in either direction the distribution curve extends, it never touches the horizontal axis -- but it gets increasingly closer.       Examples of Normal Probability Distributions:  There are many examples of random variables that are normally distributed in many different real-world settings! Here are a few examples of random variables that are normally distributed or that could be in certain situations:   Shoe sizes    blood pressure    ACT scores    birth weight of babies    salaries at a particular workplace    length of movies       The Standard Normal Distribution:  Recall that the -score of a value, , describes the number of standard deviations that the value is from the mean of its distribution:    Values of that are less than the mean have _______ -scores     postive      negative      zero      Values of that are more than the mean have _______ -scores     positive      negative      zero      The -score for the mean equals ________                                A coffee shop wants to understand the distribution of amounts that their customers are spending per order. They find that the average amount a customer spends per order is , and the standard deviation is . If we assume that the amounts spent per order are normally distributed, and Rey comes in and spends , what is the -score for Rey's order?        When the original random variable, , follows a normal distribution, -scores also follow a normal distribution with , . It is called the standard normal distribution .     Graph of Standard Normal Distribution powered by Desmos      Calculating Probabilities for Normal Distributions:  The standard normal distribution allows us to calculate probabilities for any normal distribution since we can standardize it with -scores. The tables at this link ( Standard Normal Table ) provide you with the cumulative area to the LEFT of the -score.  We can also use Excel to calculate the cumulative area to the left of the -score by typing   ( Note: We can type 1 instead of TRUE in this formula in Excel.)     Find the probability for a standard normal distribution    In Excel:      So how do we use the table or the Excel formula to find any probability for a normal distribution?  There are 3 basic types of problems:   To the left of any -score: Look up the -score in the table (or calculate it in Excel) and use the area given.    To the right of any -score: Look up the -score in the table (or calculate it in Excel) subtract the area from 1.    Between any two -scores: Look up both -scores in the table (or calculate them in Excel) and subtract the smaller area from the larger area.       Find the following probabilities for a standard normal distribution:        In Excel:         In Excel:         In Excel:      Normal Distribution Probability Calculator (Made in GeoGebra by Andreas Lindner)     We already saw an Excel command that will allow us to find a probability associated with a standard normal distribution. There is also an Excel command that allows us to find a probability associated with a general normal distribution, and in this case, we will need to specify the mean and standard deviation of the distribution. (These first two commands both apply to situations where the goal is to compute a probability associated with a data value.)    : applies to problems involving a normal distribution with a specified mean and standard deviation     : applies to problems involving the standard normal distribution ( )   (As we've seen before, cumulative .)

We're going to do an activity where we roll dice and think about the distributions of the averages of our rolls.  Use the Excel file below to record your rolls for this activity.   (If you don't have dice, you can use the tool below.)   (Made in GeoGebra by Duane Habecker)      Roll a die at least 20 times. Use the Excel file above to record what you get on each roll.

A sampling distribution of the mean is a distribution of the mean from numerous samples of the sample size. This distribution has mean and a standard error (i.e. the standard deviation of the sample means) .    There are three important properties that describe the distribution of sample means:   The sampling distribution of the mean of a random variable drawn from any population is approximately normal for sufficiently large sample size. The larger the sample size, the more closely the sample distribution resembles a normal distribution.    The mean of the sample means will be the same as the population mean; that is, .    The standard deviation of the sample means will be smaller than the standard deviation of the population; specifically,       (Donnelly 7.7)  For a population with a mean equal to 250 and a standard deviation equal to 25, calculate the standard error of the mean for the following sample sizes.   20       50       80        What can you conclude about the standard error as the sample size increases?

  "body": " The Central Limit Theorem     In short, the Central Limit Theorem says:  For any population distribution with a sufficiently large sample, the sample means are normally distributed.     There are basically three scenarios that come up that involve the use of the Central Limit Theorem:   If the samples are drawn from a normal population, then the sampling distribution of the sample means will also be normally distributed regardless of the size of the samples.    The sampling distribution of the sample means will not be normally distributed when samples of size are drawn from a population that is not necessarily normal.    If samples of size are drawn from a population that is not necessarily normal, then the Central Limit Theorem does not apply and we cannot draw conclusions about the sampling distribution of the sample means.      Bottom line: If the sample size is large enough, then we can use the Central Limit Theorem to answer the questions about sample means using the same techniques that we used to answer questions about individual values of a normally distributed population. All we need to do is adjust the -score calculation to account for the new standard deviation.    (Donnelly 7.8)  For a normal population with a mean equal to 87 and a standard deviation equal to 26, determine the probability of observing a sample mean of 90 or less from a sample of size 15.        (Donnelly 7.9)  For a population that is left-skewed with a mean of 21 and a standard deviation equal to 15, determine the probability of observing a sample mean of 18 or more from a sample of size 33.        (Donnelly 7.21)  According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), adults worked an average of 1771 hours in 2016. Assume the population standard deviation is 390 hours and that a random sample of 50 adults was selected.   Calculate the standard error of the mean.       What is the probability that the sample mean will be more than 1790 hours?       What is the probability that the sample mean will be between 1720 and 1760 hours?       Would a sample mean of 1799 hours support the claim made by the organization?    There is a chance of observing a sample mean as high as 1799, so 1799 is not unusual. Therefore, the claim is reasonable.   Identify the symmetrical interval that includes of the sample means if the true population mean is 1771 hours.        "

  "body": " The Sampling Distribution of the Proportion   So far, the focus in this chapter has been on the distribution of sample means. However, sometimes we deal with business scenarios where we are counting observations in a sample and in this case the sample proportion (or percentage), , is the statistic that is relevant rather than the sample mean, .     We're going to get in groups, and in each group, you'll roll a die times. (Use this Excel document to keep track of your rolls: ) Count how many times you roll a 1 and use that to calculate the proportion of the 30 rolls for which the result was a 1 . After the whole class finishes finding this proportion, we're going to draw a histogram of all the sample proportions. Before doing this, though, think about the following questions:    What should the distribution of your individual rolls look like (approximately)?    What do you think the approximate shape of the histogram of all sample proportions will be? (Will it be skewed left, uniform, normal\/bell-shaped, or skewed right?)    What do you expect the approximate mean of the distribution of sample proportions to be? (Will it be , , , or ?)      The sampling distribution of the proportion describes the pattern that the sample proportions tend to follow when randomly drawn from a population. This distribution has a mean, , and a standard error (i.e. the standard deviation of the sample proportions), .     (Donnelly 7.25)  For a population with a proportion equal to 0.32, calculate the standard error of the proportion for the following sample sizes.                            What can you conclude about the standard error as the sample size increases?     As the sample size increases, standard error decreases      As the sample size increases, standard error increases.      As the sample size increases, standard error stays the same.      As the sample size increases, the standard error might increase, decrease, or stay the same.      (Donnelly 7.32)  A social media survey found that of parents follow their children on Instagram. A random sample of 140 parents was selected.   Calculate the standard error of the proportion.       What is the probability that 104 or more parents from this sample follow their children on Instagram?       What is the probability that between 97 and 104 parents from this sample follow their children on Instagram?       If 81 parents responded that the follow their children on Instagram, does this result support the findings of the social media survey?    Since (less than ), the sample with only 81 parents answering yes is unusual. Therefore, the survey results are questionable.   "

The most common point estimates are the sample mean, , and the sample proportion, .     The advantage of a point estimate is that it is easy to calculate and easy to understand. The disadvantage is that it doesn't provide any information about the accuracy of the estimate. For this reason, statisticians prefer an interval estimate, a range of values used to estimate the parameter. This estimate may or may not contain the value of the parameter being estimated.  For example, let's say we work for a company with 500 employees, and we want to understand what proportion of employees is happy with their health benefits. We sample 20 employees, and in that sample, of the employees are happy with their health benefits. It is probably not the case that exactly of all employees are happy with their health benefits. However, we would like to use that point estimate of to estimate the true proportion of all employees that is happy with their health benefits.  "

We DO NOT say there is a chance that the population mean falls between A and B . It might sound the same, but it is not. The latter implies that the population mean is a variable that we can say something about. But it is not -- it is fixed, and we do not know what it is.  Remember that we develop our confidence interval based on the sampling distribution of the sample mean. We draw a sample and calculate an interval around the sample mean and say that we think we have captured the population mean within the interval -- we do NOT know anything about the population mean. We can only say something about our sample mean and interval.  If we were to repeatedly draw samples, each has the same margin of error (since the sample size and are constant for all samples), but each sample mean likely varies. After calculating all intervals, of them would result in intervals that include the population mean, but of them would have sample means so extreme (in the tail of the sampling distribution) that they would not include the population mean.

This is unrealistic -- since we are creating an interval to estimate the population mean, , we likely don't know the population standard deviation either! Hence we will estimate with the value of the sample standard deviation, . But this introduces another source of unreliability, especially in small samples. To keep the confidence interval at the desired level, we make the intervals wider by replacing the critical values in our confidence interval formula, , with larger critical values, .    The Student's -Distribution  The larger critical values come from the Student's -distribution developed in 1908 by an Irish brewing employee, William S. Gosset. He was a Guinness Brewery employee researching new methods of manufacturing ale. He needed a distribution that could be used with small samples. Employees were not allowed to publish research results, so he published under the pseudonym, Student .  The key properties of the Student's -Distribution:   It is symmetric around the mean (which is 0 just like the standard normal distribution) and mound-shaped (similar to bell-shaped).    It is a family of curves based on the concept of degrees of freedom (df) , which refer to the number of values that are free to vary. As the degrees of freedom increases, the shape of the -distribution becomes similar to the normal distribution.  When dealing with the sample mean, .    The area under the curve is equal to .    The -distribution is flatter and wider than the normal distribution. This means that the critical score for the -distribution is therefore higher than the critical -score for the same confidence level. This results in wider confidence intervals when using the -distribution.       Confidence Interval When is Unknown  The formula for the confidence interval when is unknown is: where   How do we find the critical values, ?    Table: Use this link (or Table 5 in Appendix A of the textbook). Note that you will locate the degrees of freedom along the left column and the confidence level across the top of the table -- the desired critical value is located where the two meet inside the table.

  "body": " Determining Sample Size   Let's say we want to construct a confidence interval to estimate the average GPA of students at UCCS. However, we don't want the margin of error to be too big, and we want to know how many students to survey to get the margin of error that we want.  How large a sample is necessary to make an accurate estimate? The answer is not simple, since it depends on three things:   The confidence level    The standard deviation    The margin of error     The more confident we want to be, the wider we want our interval, but there is a tradeoff. If an interval is too wide, it provides little information. On the other hand, a narrow interval requires a larger sample size and sampling can be a costly procedure. Hence it is handy to be able to be able to calculate ahead of time the sample size required to achieve a specified margin of error. With a bit of algebra on the appropriate margin of error from the confidence interval formula, we can determine the sample size.      The formula when working with a mean is:     The formula when working with a proportion is:     If necessary, round the answer UP to obtain a whole number. If you round down, then you won't achieve the desired margin of error.

  "body": " Introduction to Hypothesis Testing   Hypothesis testing is one of the most widely used procedures in statistics today, so we will spend more than one chapter discussing it. What is a hypothesis test?  The basic idea behind hypothesis testing is to assume that a population parameter equals some value (the null hypothesis), draw a sample and calculate a statistic, then use sampling distributions concepts to determine the likelihood of drawing such a sample, given the assumption of the parameter value.  Suppose we draw a random sample from the population and get a sample mean higher than the population mean. How far it is from the population mean? If > is true, what is the probability that we would get this value? Is it so different from our hypothesized mean that our hypothesis cannot be true? We have to decide what so different means. Our sampling distribution tells us that the mean of all possible sample means should be the same as >, so we can use those probability concepts to decide whether we think this sample statistic is extreme enough from the hypothesized mean to reject the null hypothesis.  The purpose of hypothesis statements is to draw a conclusion about population parameters, for which we do not have complete information.    We want to say something about the average number of hours students at UCCS work per work. Let's say that someone claims that this average is     If we survey students on campus, and in this sample the average number of hours worked per week was , would you believe the claim that ?

  "body": " The Nuts and Bolts of Hypothesis Testing   We will learn two different procedures for completing a hypothesis test, but before we describe each, let's do an example of how one of these procedures would work.    Let's say a group on campus is claiming that the average number of hours worked per week by students on campus is .  We want to see if this claim is reasonable, so we are going to go out and survey students and find the average number of hours worked per week for students in our sample.   We survey students, and the sample average is hours per week. If the population mean really is , what is the probability of getting a sample mean this extreme?   We survey students, and the sample average is hours per week. If the population mean really is , what is the probability of getting a sample mean this extreme?  (Let's use the link below to think about these questions.)           The rejection region is the range of values for a test statistic that cause us to reject .    A critical value is the boundary that separates the rejection region from the rest.    A p-value is the probability of observing a sample statistic at least as extreme as the one selected, assuming is true.        Match each situation with the correct critical value(s). (I recommend drawing a picture of the rejection region to help with this.)     A left-tailed test with significance level 0.01           A right-tailed test with            A two-tailed test with               Choose the correct p-value for each situation.

The Logic of Hypothesis Testing   The hypothesis test begins with the assumption that the null hypothesis, , is true. The goal of the process is to determine if there is enough evidence provided by the sample to infer that the alternative hypothesis, , might be true instead.  The null hypothesis can never be accepted. The most we can say is that we do not have enough evidence to reject the null. The only two options are to:   reject the null hypothesis;    fail to reject the null hypothesis.     So how is the decision made to reject or fail to reject within each of our two hypothesis testing methods?      Traditional (Critical Value) Method:   In the traditional method, the decision is made by comparing the test statistic to the critical value(s). When the test statistic falls in the rejection region, the decision is reject the null hypothesis . When the test statistic does not fall in the rejection region, the decision is fail to reject the null hypothesis .     p-value Method:   In the p-value method, the decision is made by comparing the p-value to the significance level. When the p-value is smaller than the significance level, the decision is reject the null hypothesis . When the p-value is greater than or equal to the significance level, the decision is fail to reject the null hypothesis .        Two approaches to Hypothesis Testing   Now we are finally ready to describe in depth two hypothesis testing procedures and work through some examples. First, let's summarize the steps for the traditional method (aka the critical value method).      The Traditional (Critical Value) Method of Hypothesis Testing:      Identify the two hypotheses using appropriate notation.    Draw the appropriate curve, identify the significance level, and label critical value(s).    Calculate the appropriate test statistic.    Compare the critical value(s) to the test statistic and make the decision.    State the conclusion.       Let's work through an example using the traditional method. In this example, the appropriate test statistic formula is:    (Donnelly 9.7)  A pizza place recently hired additional drivers and as a result now claims that its average delivery time for orders is under 46 minutes. A sample of 41 customer deliveries was examined, and the average delivery time was found to be 41.5 minutes. Historically, the standard deviation for delivery time is 11.8 minutes. Assuming that , does this sample provide enough evidence to support the delivery time claim made by the pizza place?   Step 1: Identify the two hypotheses using appropriate notation.       :      : ( left-tail test)      Step 2: Draw the appropriate curve, identify the significance level, and label critical value(s).     powered by Desmos      Step 3: Calculate the appropriate test statistic.       Step 4: Compare the critical value(s) to the test statistic and make the decision.   Test statistic is left of the critical value so it lands in the rejection region, and we reject  .   Step 5: State the conclusion.   There is enough evidence to support the claim that the average delivery time for orders is under 46 minutes.    (Donnelly 9.10)  A grocery store claims that customers spend an average of 5 minutes waiting for service at the store's deli counter. A random sample of 40 customers was timed at the deli counter, and the average service time was found to be 5.5 minutes. Assume the standard deviation is 1.7 minutes per customer. Assuming that , does this sample provide enough evidence to counter the claim made by the store's management?   Step 1: Identify the two hypotheses using appropriate notation.       :      : ( two-tail test)      Step 2: Draw the appropriate curve, identify the significance level, and label critical value(s).     powered by Desmos        By symmetry,    Step 3: Calculate the appropriate test statistic.       Step 4: Compare the critical value(s) to the test statistic and make the decision.   The test statistic is between the two critical values so it doesn't land in the rejection region, and we fail to reject  .   Step 5: State the conclusion.   The sample does not provide enough evidence to counter the claim that customers spend an average of 5 minutes waiting for service.      The p- Method of Hypothesis Testing:      Identify the two hypotheses using appropriate notation.    Draw the appropriate curve, identify the significance level.    Calculate the appropriate test statistic and the associated p-value.    Compare the p-value and the significance level and make the decision.    State the conclusion.        (Donnelly 9.8)  A sporting goods store believes the average age of its customers is 38 or less. A random sample of 40 customers was surveyed, and the average customer age was found to be 41.2 years. Assume the standard deviation for customer age is 9.0 years. Assuming that , does the sample provide enough evidence to refute the age claim made by the sporting goods store?   Step 1: Identify the two hypotheses using appropriate notation.       :      : ( right-tail test)      Step 2: Draw the appropriate curve, identify the significance level.     powered by Desmos      Step 3: Calculate the appropriate test statistic and the associated p-value.

We will estimate the difference between two parameters using confidence intervals as well as perform hypothesis tests to compare the difference between the two parameters. In either situation, after completing the previous chapters, you should have learned that to do various inference procedures, you really only need to know the proper sampling distribution and the format of your hypothesis. All the other concepts are the same -- just apply the correct formulas.  With two populations involving means, there are two options. Data may be collected from two completely independent populations, or pairs of data points from the two populations may be collected where they are matched in some way. Let's define these two concepts carefully before moving into the specifics of inferential statistics involving the comparison of two populations.        In independent samples , the results from one population have no impact on results obtained from the other sample.  An observation from one sample is unrelated to an observation from the other sample.

First, we will assume that the standard deviation, , is known. Then we will look at the more realistic case where is unknown.        The sampling distribution for the difference in means is normal given normal populations or large samples ( ). The mean of this sampling distribution is     The standard error for this sampling distribution is     The test statistic for a hypothesis test comparing the difference between two means with independent samples and known standard deviations is defined by: where    = the hypothesized difference in population means      (defined by the null hypothesis)     =  the standard error for the difference between the      two means     =  the difference in sample means between      Populations 1 and 2          This formula is a little unwieldy so whenever we are dealing with raw data (not just summary statistics), we will use Excel to do all the time-consuming calculations.  Now let's demonstrate the two ways we can perform this type of hypothesis test. First, in we will complete the hypothesis test by hand, manually computing all of the required calculations. Then in > we will rely on Excel to do the calculations. After stating the two hypotheses, we will navigate to the Data Analysis tool and choose z-Test Two-Sample for Means to complete the test.   (Donnelly 10.7)  Suppose the Bureau of Labor Statistics would like to investigate if the average retirement age for a worker in Japan is higher than the average retirement age for a worker in the United States. A random sample of 30 retired U.S. workers had an average retirement age of 64.6 years. A random sample of 30 retired Japanese workers had an average retirement age of 67.5 years. Assume the population standard deviation for the retirement age in the U.S. is 4.0 years and for Japan is 4.5 years. Perform a hypothesis test using to determine if the average retirement age in Japan is higher than it is in the United States.   Population 1 = average retirement age in Japan  Population 2 = average retirement age in US           critical value:   standard error:   test statistic:   Since the test statistic is bigger than the critical value and this is a right-tail test, we reject .  There is enough evidence to conclude that the average retirement age in Japan is higher than in the USA.    (Donnelly Your Turn 1)  Major League Baseball officials (and many fans) have been concerned about the lengths of games, particularly playoff games. Suppose the officials would like to test the hypothesis that the mean length of a playoff game is longer than the mean length of a regular season game. The data in the Excel file below shows the length of games, in minutes, for randomly selected games from the regular season and from the playoffs. Assume the standard deviations of the playoff and regular season games are 25 and 21 minutes respectively. Using , can we conclude that playoff games are longer, on average, than regular season games?         The sample provides enough evidence to conclude that the average length of playoff games is longer than the average length of regular season games.     The formula for the confidence interval for the difference between two means given known standard deviations is where again     the standard error for the difference between two means      the difference in sample means between Populations 1 and 2     Remember that the book likes to identify the two sides of the interval as LCL (lower confidence limit) and UCL (upper confidence limit).     (Donnelly 10.9)  Expedia.com would like to estimate the difference between the average rental price of a car with automatic transmission versus the average rental price of a car with manual transmission at a certain airport. The table below shows the average one-week rental prices for two random samples, as well as the population standard deviations and sample sizes for each type of car.       Sample mean  Sample size  Population standard deviation    Automatic       Manual        Construct a confidence interval to estimate the difference in the average cost of a one-week rental between these two types of cars at the airport. Can you conclude that a difference exists in the average rental price of the two types of cars?      Population 1: automatic    Population 2: manual   Formula:   Standard error:      MOE:   LCL:   UCL:   We are confident that   Since the interval does not contain 0, we can conclude that there is a difference in the average cost of a rental with different transmissions.   When we don't know the population standard deviations, we substitute the sample standard deviations in their place. Recall from that this means the proper sampling distribution is the Student's -distribution instead of the normal distribution (as long as the sample sizes are large and\/or the samples are drawn from normal populations).  In addition, we also need to determine whether or not to assume that the unknown variances are equal or unequal. We could use the -test from to draw this conclusion -- but most of the time (in this class) you will be told which situation applies. Let's examine the formulas associated with each of these two cases.      Case 1: The population variances are not equal , i.e.,   The test statistic and confidence interval formulas are where       the hypothesized difference in population means (defined by the null hypothesis)      the difference in sample means between Populations 1 and 2      the variance and size, respectively, of the sample from Population 1      the variance and size, respectively, of the sample from Population 2     The test statistic, , has degrees of freedom, , defined by the following formula:   This looks messy, but note that you've already computed and during the test statistic calculation!     Case 2: The population variances are equal , i.e.   In this scenario, the denominator of the test statistic (which recall from Case 1 includes the sample variances) gets simplified because we can pool the two sample variances.  The test statistic and confidence interval formulas are:   The pooled variance , , is the weighted average of 2 sample variances drawn from 2 populations.  This formula is actually quite easy to use:   The test statistic, , has degrees of freedom, .     Once again, we will rely on Excel to do these computations for us whenever we have raw data. After stating the two hypotheses, go to the Data Analysis tool and choose t-Test Two-Sample Assuming Equal Variances or t-Test Two-Sample Assuming Unequal Variances to complete the test.   (Donnelly 10.52)  The airline industry measures fuel efficiency by calculating how many miles one seat can travel, whether occupied or not, on one gallon of jet fuel. The data in the Excel file below shows the fuel economy, in miles per seat, for 15 randomly selected flights on Delta and US Airways. Perform a hypothesis test using to determine if the average fuel efficiency differs between the two airlines. Assume the population variances for the fuel efficiency for these two airlines are not equal.           (Donnelly 10.45)  During a decline in the housing market in the 2010s, it appeared that the average size of a newly-constructed house fell. To investigate this trend, the square footages of a random sample of houses built in 2008 were compared to houses in 2018. The following table summarizes the sample means and standard deviations for the two samples drawn in 2008 and 2018.

So now it's time to look at the difference between two population proportions. There are many interesting business applications for this scenario. For example, perhaps USAA would like to know if the proportion of young male drivers who have car accidents differs from the proportion of young female drivers who have car accidents.   The sampling distribution for the difference in proportions is approximately normal as long as we have relatively large ( ) sample sizes. The mean of this sampling distribution is .  The standard error for this distribution is   However, and are unknown and so the sample proportions, and , computed from the sample data, are used as estimates. This allows us to approximate the standard error for the difference in population proportions with:   So the confidence interval for the difference between the two proportions is found using the formula:   And the test statistic for the hypothesis test for the difference between two proportions is defined by the formula:   However, if we assume that in the null hypothesis (i.e. there is no difference in the population proportions, , which is very common), the sample data can be pooled.

Data for these variables can be found in the table in the Excel file below.    Construct a regression model using all three independent variables.

Similar to what we did in a previous chapter, we will construct a confidence interval to aid in describing the accuracy of our predictions.   There are a number of confidence intervals that we can create based on our regression model that provide insight into the validity of the model.

Let's look back at the hospital example from earlier.  A hospital would like to develop a regression model to predict the total hospital bill for a patient based on the age of the patient ( ), the patient's length of stay ( ), and the number of days in the hospital's intensive care unit (ICU) ( ). Data for these variables can be found in the table in the Excel file below.   (Here are the solutions to all parts of this problem: )   Find and interpret the adjusted coefficient of variation.   Let , and test the following hypothesis:       Let , and test to see if each of the s is equal to zero.   Construct and interpret the confidence interval for the regression coefficient for each of the independent variables in the model.   "

  "body": " Diamonds Modeling   (Background on diamonds was provided in part by research done at https:\/\/www.brilliance.com\/education\/diamonds\/depth-table)  When a gemologist determines the value of a diamond, he or she considers a number of different factors. These factors are known as the 4C's (carat, color, clarity, and cut). How large is the diamond? The size (really the weight) of the diamond is measured in carats. Is it colorless or does it have a slight hue of color? Are there any visible inclusions in the diamond (this affects the clarity)?  Was the stone cut well? This is described by both the table and the depth. They both helps to define the physical shape of a diamond and contribute to its sparkle. When these two features are proportioned just right, a diamond of any size looks spectacular.  Every diamond has a flat, square-shaped facet on its top called the table. It plays a critical role in a diamond’s appearance. The table refracts rays of light as they pass, directing them to the facets that make the diamond look so sparkly. The physical size of the table facet naturally varies depending on the overall size of the diamond. Jewelers measure the table percentage when grading a diamond’s cut. Table percentage is calculated by dividing the width of the table by the overall width of the diamond. The ideal table percentage will vary based on the shape of the diamond.  The depth of a diamond might also be called the “height”: it is the distance from the table to the culet (the pointed tip) of the diamond. Like with a diamond’s table, jewelers grade a diamond’s depth based on its depth percentage. Depth percentage is the diamond’s depth divided by the width of the diamond. This percentage dictates the overall proportions of the diamond, which in turn directly impact how light reflects off the facets in the stone.    Here is the file we are going to use for this problem:   The price of diamonds is not just determined by size, but by multiple characteristics. For simplicity, in this example we will start with size. Create the scatterplot for the two variables Price and Carat .  (The solutions to all parts of this problem are here: )   Determine the least squares line. Interpret the slope coefficient.   According to your least squares line, what would you expect the price to be for a 5 carat diamond?   Compute the coefficient of correlation. What does it tell you about the relationship between the size of a diamond and the price?    We're going to use the same file we used in the previous problem:   Now we will take into consideration the other characteristics of diamonds that determine price: carat, color, clarity, and cut. Let's redo the regression and create a model that does a better job than the one in the previous example that only included a single predictor variable.  (The solutions to all parts of this problem are here: )   Create the regression model with all 5 variables that are provided: color, depth (in percentage), clarity, table (in percentage), and carat.   Interpret each of the coefficients in the model.   Do all 5 of the predictor variables belong in the model? Why or why not?   Is the overall model valid? Why or why not?   What is the coefficient of determination? What does it tell you about the model?   Remove variables one by one and reassess the model. What is the best model to predict the price of a diamond? Why?
